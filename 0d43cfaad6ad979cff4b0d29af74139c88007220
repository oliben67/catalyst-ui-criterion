# Software Engineering Module Invariants

The invariants the `software-engineering` process module adds to catalyst.
Read together with the kernel's `INVARIANTS.md` — this file extends it and
never overrides it (`MODULE-SPECIFICATION.md` §6.4). Invariants that moved
here from the kernel keep their original `INV-N` number; the kernel keeps a
one-line placeholder for each and never reuses the number. Entries marked
*(module part)* extend a kernel invariant that still exists there.

Keep this file as lean as the kernel's: rationale and examples belong in the
module's definitions and in the deployed `Rules-of-Rules.md`.

## Structural

- **INV-5 — Chain invariant *(module part)*.** This module's grounding type
  is `rule`: `REQ`/`BUG`/`HK`/`TEST` → rule → domain. `STEP-`, `FEAT-`, and
  `RM-` are exempt from asserting a rule target of their own (INV-9,
  INV-27). With an agile project-management plugin active (kernel INV-22),
  the chain reads `epic → story → task → REQ`/`BUG`/`HK` → rule → domain;
  without one, `REQ`/`BUG`/`HK` chains directly to rule → domain, the same
  way house-keeping's "no rule applies" is already a legitimate, explicit
  answer.
- **INV-9 — Requirements, not bugs, for new work.** `FEAT-` entries are
  non-rule-linked roadmap. When work on one starts it becomes a `REQ-` (never a
  `BUG-`), which is vetted against every rule, assigned a domain, and measured.
- **INV-14 — Persisted backlog.** `development/BACKLOG.md` always exists,
  seeded from `templates/backlog.template.md`. It is never hand-edited —
  `/show-backlog` overwrites it in full every run, so it can't drift from
  the real indexes.
- **INV-15 — Machine-maintained roadmap tracking.** `development/roadmaps/`
  and its `roadmaps.md` index always exist (empty is fine); individual named
  roadmaps are created only via `/roadmap-add`. In every
  `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`, the Status/Linked columns are set only
  by the `/roadmap-*` commands and `/show-backlog` — never hand-edited.
  `/roadmap-remove` never deletes a roadmap with linked items; it retires
  it in place.
- **INV-16 — Advisory role signing *(module part)*.** Every dev-artifact
  (`BUG-`/`REQ-`/`HK-`/`TEST-`), step, feature, and roadmap item carries a
  `Signed-off-by` field, checked against `IAM/roles/roles.json` in the same
  advisory way as the kernel's.
- **INV-26 — Signed entity IDs *(module part)*.** Every `BUG-`/`REQ-`/
  `HK-`/`TEST-`, `FEAT-`, `RM-`, and `STEP-` ID carries its
  creator/signer's `userid` as a trailing `-XXXXXXXX` suffix, assigned once
  at creation and never changed thereafter, appended after the zero-padded
  sequence number (`Rules-of-Rules.md` rr-META-020).
- **INV-27 — Steps record a requirement's or bug's actual implementation
  work.** `STEP-NNNNNN` (`templates/step.template.md`) names exactly one
  parent — a `REQ-NNNNNN` or a `BUG-NNNNNN`, the `Parent` field — and
  records one concrete unit of implementation work performed toward it —
  files touched, commands run, how it was verified. Its own top-level
  `steps/` folder, sibling of `requirements/`, full INV-20 treatment.
  Exempt from the chain invariant's rule-targeting requirement (INV-5)
  the same way `FEAT-`/`RM-` are — it inherits its parent's
  already-vetted rule target rather than asserting one of its own. Both
  the requirement and bug templates carry a `Steps` field listing every
  step opened against that instance; neither is closeable as `done`/
  `fixed` until every one of its steps is `done` or `abandoned`
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` rr-META-021). A roadmap row's `Linked` field is a
  list, not a single ID: a roadmap item of real size
  is expected to decompose into more than one requirement, each
  accumulating its own steps.
- **INV-28 — Tests are development artifacts with optional (0,n) links.**
  `TEST-NNNNNN` (`templates/test.template.md`) joined the
  `(BUG|REQ|HK|TEST)` development-artifact format at framework `0.30.0`
  — unlike `STEP-`/`FEAT-`/`RM-`, it is **not** exempt from the chain
  invariant (INV-5): a test always carries its own `Targets`/`Domain`
  and is subject to `rules-of-development.md` §1. Its own top-level
  `tests/` folder, sibling of `requirements/`/`steps/`, full INV-20
  treatment. Two additional, independent `(0,n)` fields — `Requirements`
  (zero or more `REQ-NNNNNN`) and `Steps` (zero or more `STEP-NNNNNN`)
  it verifies — both optional; a test naming neither is valid as long as
  it still carries `Targets`/`Domain`. Many-to-many: one requirement or
  step may be verified by several tests, and one test may verify several
  requirements and/or steps at once. Back-referenced on the other side:
  a requirement and a step each gain their own `Tests` field, listing
  every `TEST-NNNNNN` that names them — populated automatically by
  `/create-test` in the same action, never hand-edited
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` rr-META-022).
