# `CONTRACT` — Parser/model/validator/watcher contract

**Document:** rules/catalyst-core-rules.md
**Name:** parser-model-validator-watcher-contract
**Defined:** 2026-09-05
**Parent:** none
**Sub-domains:** none

Rules in this domain do not supersede, amend, or contradict any rule in
another domain unless explicitly stated below against that rule's ID.

## Scope

The behavioral guarantees `catalyst-core` makes to every consumer built
on top of it (the VS Code host, the Electron host, and `catalyst-ui`
itself): what the typed chain model contains, when validation runs and
what it catches, and the watcher's change-notification contract. This
is product behavior, not tooling — distinct from `env-*`'s dev-
environment rules.

## Relationship to other domains

None.
