# `INSPECTOR` — Chain tree and node-detail webview contract

**Document:** rules/catalyst-host-vscode-rules.md
**Name:** chain-tree-and-node-detail-webview-contract
**Defined:** 2026-09-05
**Parent:** none
**Sub-domains:** none

Rules in this domain do not supersede, amend, or contradict any rule in
another domain unless explicitly stated below against that rule's ID.

## Scope

The behavioral guarantees `catalyst-host-vscode` makes for the read-only
chain inspector: how the extension resolves which catalyst deployment to
inspect for the opened project, the sidebar tree's shape, and the
extension↔webview message contract for node detail. Consumes
`catalyst-core`'s typed chain model and watcher (`core-CONTRACT-000001-UVqkd7cL`) and
`catalyst-ui`'s shared React surfaces — does not redefine either.

## Relationship to other domains

Depends on `CONTRACT` (`rules/catalyst-core-rules.md`) for the chain
model and watcher this domain's rule builds on; does not amend it.
