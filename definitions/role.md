## Description

A role is a named entry in `IAM/roles/roles.json` mapping to a list of actions
it's permitted to take — which slash commands or responsibilities (e.g.
"approve rule changes", "cutting releases") belong to it. Users are assigned
one or more roles via `/user-assign-role`; roles themselves are managed via
`/role-add`/`/role-modify`.
