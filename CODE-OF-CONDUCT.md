# Rules of Development — template

> Instantiates the catalyst kernel's development-rules template (`framework/kernel/rules-of-development.template.md` in the `catalyst` repository), with the active module's `code-of-conduct.module.md` §3 and §4 inserted at the end of the matching sections under `### From module software-engineering` (`MODULE-SPECIFICATION.md` §6.2).

Standards for how development work — the active module's development
artifacts and meta-tags — gets proposed, tracked, and closed. Subordinate to
[`rules/Rules-of-Rules.md`](rules/Rules-of-Rules.md):
that file governs the rules themselves; this file governs the work items
that reference those rules.

---

## 1. No development without a targeted rule

**No rule-linked development artifact of the active module, and no
meta-tag, may start without citing one or more existing rule IDs in its
`Targets` field when the tag is
used to annotate a rule-linked artifact.** If no rule currently covers the
behavior in question:

1. Define the rule(s) first, as a normal edit to the relevant rule
document.
2. That definition must satisfy `Rules-of-Rules.md` §1 (conflict check)
and follow the ID scheme in §3.
3. Only then open the `<PREFIX>-NNNNNN` item, citing the new ID(s).

The active module may declare an entity type for which "no rule applies"
is a legitimate answer (pure repo hygiene with no bearing on any documented
behavior or process) — but it must be stated explicitly, not left blank.
Likewise, a change that alters no rule's behaviour at all may be a
**chore** (§9): no artifact, one journal entry whose empty `targets`
states explicitly that it serves no rule — when the active module defines
ceremony tiers (its §3 contribution).

## 2. Users, roles, and signing

`IAM/users/users.json` is a JSON array of registered users
(`{name, roles, registered, active, notes, userid}`, plus an optional
`git_username`, the name `catalyst criterion push` commits under —
`Rules-of-Rules.md` §13), managed only by
`/user-add`/`/user-remove`/`/user-modify`/`/user-assign-role`/`/user-list`
— see §4. A `Signed-off-by` value resolves a user by `name`,
`git_username` or `userid`; one already written is never rewritten.
Each user has one or
more roles drawn from
`IAM/roles/roles.json`, a JSON array of `{name, actions}` objects
mapping each role to the actions/commands it's expected to perform.
`roles.json` is seeded with a default agile-role mapping
(`templates/roles.template.json`) and then extended via `/role-add`
(new role) or `/role-modify` (change an existing role's actions).

**This is JSON, not hand-edited markdown, precisely because it's managed
exclusively by commands** — the same reasoning that keeps
regenerated summary documents machine-only, just with structured data
instead of a regenerated document.

**Hard requirement: `IAM/users/users.json` must always have at least
one entry with `"active": true`.** A project with nobody registered has
nobody to sign work. `/user-remove` must refuse rather than silently
drop the last active user to zero — this specific case isn't advisory,
since it would break this hard requirement (INV-25's
fundamental-invariant exception to acting without asking).

**Beyond that one hard requirement, this role model is advisory, not an
access-control system, and per INV-25 it never pauses for authorization
either.** Catalyst has no way to verify who is actually typing, so a
role mismatch is noted, never a block or a confirmation prompt:

1. Before an artifact-creating or work-item-status-changing command
   completes, resolve who is signing it: the user established earlier
   this session, or ask if not yet established (don't guess from git
   config — confirm with the user).
2. Look up that name in `IAM/users/users.json`. If unregistered, proceed
   anyway, noting that the signer isn't registered — `/user-add` can
   register them properly as a follow-up, but doesn't gate this write.
3. Look up their role(s) in `IAM/roles/roles.json` and check whether the
   action being performed is one that role covers. If it isn't, proceed
   anyway — never refuse outright — noting the mismatch.
4. Fill the artifact's `Signed-off-by` field with the user's name
   (carrying forward any unregistered-signer or role-mismatch note from
   steps 2-3) and proceed.
5. Allocate the entity's ID with `catalyst id next <PREFIX> --as <signer>`
   (`CLI.md`), which carries that signer's `userid` as its suffix
   (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §20, INV-26) — the same moment, never a separate
   step done later. Always pass the signer confirmed in step 1 as `--as`;
   the CLI's own fallback to the git identity is not a confirmation. If
   the signer has no `userid` yet (unregistered, or registered before
   INV-26 existed), register them first (`/user-add`); the CLI refuses to
   allocate a suffixed ID ahead of its signer.

Every development artifact of the active module and every work item
carries a `Signed-off-by` field for this reason (see each type's
template). It records who actually signed the artifact, which may differ
from who typed the command on their behalf.

## 3. Standard document types

The kernel defines one document type of its own; the active module's
document types are appended at the end of this section
(`MODULE-SPECIFICATION.md` §6.2).

| Type | Folder | Template | ID prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta-tag | `meta-tags/` | `templates/meta-tag.template.md` | `TAG-<KEY>-<ARTEFACT-ID>` |

The active module states, for each of its entity types, whether it is
rule-linked (bound by this document's rules — `Targets`, `Domain`, closed
against a rule) or exempt from them, and how its entity types relate to
one another.

### Hard rule: individual files and indexes

- **This is a hard requirement.** Every rule-linked development artifact
  of the active module, and every meta-tag, must be stored as its own
  individual markdown file in the corresponding folder, not only as
  free-form notes or grouped content.
- **This is also a hard requirement.** Every item must be listed in the
  corresponding type index file so the repository has an authoritative catalog
  of the concrete documents that exist.
- Each item directory must also contain an index file named after the item
  type — `<folder>/<folder>.md` for each of the active module's entity
  types, and `meta-tags/meta-tags.md` for the meta-tag index.
- These index files are the canonical indexes for their directory. Each
  entity type's index is regenerated from the artifact files with
  `catalyst index regen`, never edited by hand or merged; `meta-tags/meta-tags.md`,
  which is not an entity type's index, is kept by `/meta-tag`.
- **This is a hard requirement, stricter than the others above.**
  `IAM/users/users.json` and `IAM/roles/roles.json` always exist, and
  `users.json` must contain **at least one entry with `"active": true`** —
  not "empty is fine," since a project with nobody registered has nobody
  to sign work. Both files are managed only by the `/user-*`/`/role-*`
  commands (§2, §4), never hand-edited. See `INVARIANTS.md` INV-16.
- **This is a hard requirement.** `development/journal.jsonl` always
  exists (empty is fine). Once a line is appended it is never edited,
  deleted, or reordered — stricter than every other "never hand-edited"
  rule above, since even the commands that write to it only ever append.
  See `INVARIANTS.md` INV-17 and §9.

- **Meta-tag**: a lightweight annotation attached to an existing artifact.
  It stores one key/value pair whose key is one of `comment`, `version`, or
  `link-to`, and it is saved under the name `tag-<key>-<artefact-id>`.

### From module software-engineering

This module contributes seven entity types. Four of them — bugs,
requirements, house-keeping items, and tests — are **development
artifacts**, fully bound by `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §1 (`Targets`, `Domain`,
closed against a rule). Feature entries, roadmap items, and steps are
related but exempt schemes, described after the table.

| Type | Folder | Template | ID prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bug | `development/bugs/` | `templates/bug.template.md` | `BUG-NNNNNN` |
| Requirement | `requirements/` | `templates/requirement.template.md` | `REQ-NNNNNN` |
| House-keeping | `development/house-keeping/` | `templates/house-keeping.template.md` | `HK-NNNNNN` |
| Test | `tests/` | `templates/test.template.md` | `TEST-NNNNNN` |

House-keeping is this module's one category where "no rule applies" is a
legitimate answer to `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §1 (pure repo hygiene with no
bearing on any documented behavior or process) — but it must be stated
explicitly, not left blank. It stays available for housekeeping worth
tracking, but a chore (below) no longer needs one.

#### Ceremony tiers

Every change is one of three tiers (`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §9,
`INVARIANTS.module.md` INV-27), and carries only that tier's ceremony:

| Tier | When | What it needs | Journal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **chore** | No rule's behaviour changes: a typo, formatting, a comment, a dependency bump without behaviour change, a documentation fix. | No artifact. | One entry: `catalyst journal append --command chore --action update --tier chore --artifact "<short description>" --intent "<goal>" --file ...`, with no `--target` (`targets: []` — explicitly no rule, INV-5). |
| **fix** | Restores the behaviour a documented rule already describes. | A `BUG-` targeting that rule; steps optional. | `--tier fix` on its entries. |
| **feature** | New or changed behaviour. | A `REQ-`, vetted against every rule document and targeting or proposing rules (`rr-META-000001-UVqkd7cL`); `STEP-`s opened as the work happens, at least one before it closes; tests as §3's test entries and the rules' test plans require. | `--tier feature` on its entries. |

The agent picks the tier, **states it to the user before starting**, and
escalates (chore → fix → feature) as soon as the change turns out bigger —
opening the artifact the new tier needs at that point, never
retroactively (`INVARIANTS.md` INV-29). When unsure, the higher tier.
A feature-tier change is a `REQ-`, not a feature entry: a `FEAT-` (below)
records an idea before any work starts, and becomes a `REQ-` when it does.

Feature entries (`FEAT-NNNNNN`, folder `features/`, template
`templates/feature.template.md` → `TEMPLATE-FEATURE-vN.md`) are a related but
**separate, non-rule-linked** scheme — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000009-UVqkd7cL`.
They document possible future work, are not one of the four
development-artifact types above, and are exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s
rules (no `Targets`, no `Domain`, never "done" against a rule). When a new
feature actually needs to be developed, open a `REQ-NNNNNN` requirement —
never a `BUG-NNNNNN` — to track it.

Roadmap items (`RM-NNNNNN`, table rows inside `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`
files — one file per named roadmap, template `templates/roadmap.template.md`,
index `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md`) sit one level above feature entries
— see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000010-UVqkd7cL`. They are populated by
`/roadmap-add`/`/roadmap-update`/`/roadmap-merge` from an external source file
rather than created one at a time, and are exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s
rules the same way feature entries are (no `Targets`, no `Domain`, never
"done" against a rule). Formalizing a roadmap item means opening a
`FEAT-NNNNNN` for it via `/create-feature`, citing the `RM-NNNNNN` ID in the
feature's `Roadmap` field. A roadmap item of real size is expected to
decompose into **more than one** requirement rather than one oversized
`REQ-NNNNNN` standing in for the whole item — its row's `Linked` field names
every `FEAT-`/`REQ-NNNNNN` currently associated with it, not just one.

Steps (`STEP-NNNNNN`, folder `steps/`, template `templates/step.template.md`)
sit one level *below* a requirement or a bug — see `Rules-of-Rules.md`
`rr-META-000021-UVqkd7cL`. Each names exactly one parent — a `REQ-NNNNNN` or a `BUG-NNNNNN`
(the `Parent` field) — and records one concrete unit of implementation
work performed toward it (files touched, commands run, how it was
verified). Like feature entries and roadmap items, a step is exempt from
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s rules (no `Targets`, no `Domain` of its own — it
inherits its parent's), but unlike them it's created *during* active
implementation, not before it: a requirement (a feature, in tier terms)
has steps opened as its work happens and cannot close without at least
one; a bug's steps are optional. Neither moves to one of its ETD's
closed states (requirement: `Completed`/`Abandoned`; bug:
`Closed`/`WontFix`) while any of its steps is still `planned` or
`in-progress` — each must be `done` or `abandoned` first. Opened and
closed as the work itself happens, not batched afterward, per
`INVARIANTS.md` INV-29.

Tests (`TEST-NNNNNN`, folder `tests/`, template `templates/test.template.md`)
join this module's development-artifact types as of framework `0.30.0` — see
`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000022-UVqkd7cL`. Unlike features, roadmap items, and steps,
a test is **not** exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s rules: it always carries
its own `Targets`/`Domain`, vetted the same way a bug or requirement is. On
top of that, a test may independently name `(0,n)` `REQ-NNNNNN` and `(0,n)`
`STEP-NNNNNN` it verifies — both optional, and neither implies the other.
Named requirements/steps get the new test's ID appended to their own `Tests`
field in the same action — the mirror image of a requirement's `Steps` field.

#### Hard rule: individual files and indexes

- Bugs, requirements, house-keeping items, and tests each follow
  `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §3's individual-file and index hard rules. Their
  index files are:
  - `development/bugs/bugs.md` for the bug index.
  - `requirements/requirements.md` for the requirements index.
  - `development/house-keeping/house-keeping.md` for the house-keeping index.
  - `tests/tests.md` for the test index.
  - Feature entries and steps are indexed the same way, in
    `features/features.md` and `steps/steps.md`.
  - Every one of these indexes is regenerated from the artifact files by
    `catalyst index regen` (`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §3), never hand-edited.
    Roadmaps are the exception: their items are rows of hand-edited
    tables (`naming: free-form`), and `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md`
    is kept by the `/roadmap-*` commands.
- **This is a hard requirement.** `development/BACKLOG.md` always
  exists — seeded from `templates/backlog.template.md` on first deploy —
  as the go-to document for developers to review work to be done and
  current status. It is not hand-maintained: `/show-backlog` regenerates
  it in full every time it runs, so it never drifts from the real
  indexes — including every `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`. See
  `INVARIANTS.module.md` INV-14.
- **This is also a hard requirement.** `development/roadmaps/` and its
  `roadmaps.md` index always exist (empty is fine — individual named
  roadmaps are created only via `/roadmap-add`). Within any
  `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` that does exist, only the
  `/roadmap-add`/`-update`/`-merge`/`-remove` commands and `/show-backlog`
  (Status/Linked refresh) ever change it; hand-editing anything but a
  row's Notes column is pointless, the same way hand-editing `BACKLOG.md`
  is. See `INVARIANTS.module.md` INV-15.

- **Bug**: an existing ✅ rule doesn't actually hold in the running system,
  or formalizes an already-known ⚠️/❌ rule into trackable, closeable work.
  Never introduces a new rule by itself.
- **Requirement**: an explicit, tracked requirement that captures
  user/business behavior that must be implemented and tested — this is the
  artifact to open when a new feature needs to be developed, never a bug. It
  must be vetted against every existing rule document (`Rules-of-Rules.md`
  `rr-META-000001-UVqkd7cL` conflict check) before it's opened, it always carries a
  `Domain`, and it always answers — targets and/or proposes — one or more
  rules (and, if needed, a new domain — see `Rules-of-Rules.md`
  `rr-META-000006-UVqkd7cL`/`rr-META-000007-UVqkd7cL`) inline in the requirement doc so rule and
  requirement are reviewed together. None of those three are optional.
- **House-keeping**: dev-support tooling/process, not product behavior.
  Still targets a rule where one exists — most commonly a `rr-META-*`
  process rule.
- **Test**: verifies that a targeted rule actually holds, the same
  `Targets`/`Domain` requirement as a bug or requirement. Optionally
  names `(0,n)` requirements and/or `(0,n)` steps it verifies, on top of
  its own rule target — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000022-UVqkd7cL`.

#### Rule documents' Linked Artifacts quick index

Every rule document carries a `## Linked Artifacts — Quick Index` heading
(kernel `INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md` §1). This module lists there each open
`BUG-NNNNNN` whose `Targets` include one of the document's rules, as
`BUG-NNNNNN — <Name> (<Status>)`, and removes the line once the bug is
closed. Other artifact types are not listed.

#### Domain field

Feature entries under `features/` (and roadmap items and steps) are not
development artifacts under `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` and carry no `Domain`
field of their own — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000009-UVqkd7cL`.

#### Development-artifact IDs

Per `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000006-UVqkd7cL`: `(BUG|REQ|HK|TEST)-(NNNNNN)-(userid)`,
global per type, sequential, zero-padded 6 digits, never reused, plus the
signer's `userid` suffix (`rr-META-000020-UVqkd7cL`, INV-26), under
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §6's naming rule. Every ID of this module's types —
`STEP-`, `FEAT-` and `RM-` included — comes from
`catalyst id next <PREFIX> --as <signer>`, never from reading an index by
hand. Example:
`BUG-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation` or
`BUG-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation.md`, and
`REQ-000002-Ab3xR9pQ-password-reset-flow` or
`REQ-000002-Ab3xR9pQ-password-reset-flow.md`.

#### Closing an item

Before closing a bug or requirement, ensure the corresponding entry exists in
its individual file and is reflected in the relevant index file
(`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §7).

Each type's Status takes exactly its entity type definition's
`allowed_values`, and "closed" means one of its `closed_states`. Only the
requirement's `Steps` check below is enforced by `catalyst validate`; the
rest are this module's rules, applied by the agent and the reviewer.

- **Bug** (`Open` → `Under Review` → `Fixed` → `Closed`, or `WontFix`;
  closed states `Closed`/`WontFix`): fix-tier work, steps optional. Does not
  move to `Closed`/`WontFix` while any `STEP-NNNNNN` in its `Steps` field is
  not `done` or `abandoned` (`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000021-UVqkd7cL`). Its Test
  plan should name the test covering the fix before it moves to `Closed` —
  guidance, not a tool-enforced condition.
- **Requirement** (`Draft` → `Proposed` → `Vetted` → `Active` →
  `Completed`, or `Abandoned`; closed states `Completed`/`Abandoned`):
  feature-tier work. Its `Steps` field must name at least one step before
  it closes (`required_when_closed` in its ETD — `catalyst validate`
  reports a closed requirement without one as `closed-incomplete`), and
  every `STEP-NNNNNN` in it is `done` or `abandoned` (`Rules-of-Rules.md`
  `rr-META-000021-UVqkd7cL`). It moves to `Completed` once its acceptance criteria and
  rule targets are reflected in the implementation; tests follow the test
  entries of §3 and its own Test plan — guidance, not a tool-enforced
  condition.
- **Step** (`planned` → `in-progress` → `done`, or `abandoned`): not
  `done` without its own Verification section filled in; `abandoned`
  requires a reason there instead.
- **House-keeping** (`Open` → `Completed`): `Completed` once its stated
  verification passes.
- **Test** (`Draft` → `Active` → `Passing`/`Failing`, or `Disabled`;
  closed state `Passing`): not `Passing` without its own Actual outcome
  section reflecting a real run; `Failing`/`Disabled` require the same
  section explaining why.

Closing a bug as `WontFix` or a requirement as `Abandoned` never retires
the rule(s) it targeted, and vice versa (`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §8).

## 4. Slash-command entry points

The framework exposes the following kernel slash commands. The active
module's commands are appended at the end of this section
(`MODULE-SPECIFICATION.md` §6.2); kernel and module entries together are
this deployment's canonical command list.

Mechanical steps are calls to the catalyst CLI (`CLI.md`), never
re-derived by hand. **`catalyst <args>`** is shorthand for
`python3 .criterion/bin/catalyst.pyz <args>` (or `task catalyst -- <args>`).
`catalyst spec <name>` prints one command's own bullet and procedure from
this section; command files read that instead of the whole document.
Every command that creates or changes an artifact, rule, domain or
`Status` ends the same way, after its own steps below:

1. `catalyst index regen` — rebuild every entity index from the files.
2. `catalyst journal append --command /<name> --action <action>
   --artifact <id> [--target <rule-id> ...] [--tier <tier>]
   --intent "<goal>" --file <path> ...` — one entry covering every touched
   file (§9).
3. `catalyst check` — unless the agent's end-of-turn hook already runs
   `catalyst hook stop`; resolve every error before reporting.

A product commit made for the change cites the artifact or rule it serves
(or its subject starts `chore:`) — §9, "Traced commits".

- `/user-add <name> <role>` — register a new user in
  `IAM/users/users.json` with an initial role from
  `IAM/roles/roles.json`. Refuses if `<name>` is already registered —
  use `/user-modify`/`/user-assign-role` instead.
- `/user-remove <name>` — set `<name>`'s `active` field to `false` in
  `IAM/users/users.json`. Never deletes the entry (see §2). Refuses if
  this would leave zero active users (hard rule, §2).
- `/user-modify <name> <field> <value>` — edit `<name>`'s `notes` or
  `active` field. Refuses for `roles` (use `/user-assign-role`) and for
  identity/audit fields (`name`, `registered`).
- `/user-assign-role <name> <role>` — add `<role>` to `<name>`'s `roles`
  array (additive; doesn't remove their other roles).
- `/user-list [--role <role>] [--active-only]` — list registered users,
  optionally filtered.
- `/role-add <role> <actions>` — add a new role entry to
  `IAM/roles/roles.json`. Refuses if `<role>` already exists — use
  `/role-modify` instead.
- `/role-modify <role> <actions>` — replace an existing role's `actions`.
  Refuses if `<role>` doesn't exist — use `/role-add` instead.
**`/create-epic`, `/create-story`, `/create-task`, `/create-spike`,
`/create-sprint`, `/create-board`, `/create-workflow` are not core
commands.** `work-items/` and its seven artifact types are
plugin-territory (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §8, INV-22) — these commands only
exist in a deployment once a project-management-type plugin extending
`plugins/_prototyping/project-management/agile/`'s schema is activated;
that plugin's own `working-contract.md` `## Contributes` section is
their spec, not this document. No concrete plugin exists yet, so none of
the seven currently exist anywhere.
- `/meta-tag` — create a new meta-tag artifact, save it as
  `tag-<key>-<artefact-id>`, register it in `meta-tags/meta-tags.md`, and
  link it to the specified artifact.
- `/list <type> [--filter ...]` — list artifacts, work items, rules, or
  templates of the requested type. Use `all` to list everything. Each
  `--filter` is a property filter expressed as `key=value` or
  `key="value*"`; filters apply across the selected collection. If the
  requested type is `template`, the command requires an additional
  `--type <template-type>` argument to identify which template family to
  inspect.
- `/freeze <item-id|item-path|type|template-name>` — protect the resolved
  item from `/sync-framework` by recording its file path in a root-level
  `.frozen` file. The command accepts one of four argument forms: an item
  ID, an item path, a type, or a template name.
- `/migrate-definition <entity-type> <version>` — the only way to move a
  deployed `definitions/<entity-type>.md` forward once it exists
  (`INVARIANTS.md` INV-23: ordinary `/sync-framework` never touches one
  that already exists). Refuses if `<entity-type>` isn't a real entity
  type, or if `<version>` doesn't exist for it in this framework's own
  `definitions/<entity-type>/` folder.
- `/catalyzer <subcommand>` — manage plugin installation and activation through
  the framework interface. Every subcommand resolves plugins against the
  registry file `framework/kernel/plugins/<type>/catalog.md` in catalyst's
  own repository (currently only `framework/kernel/plugins/repository/catalog.md`,
  since the repository type is the only
  plugin type defined at this time), which is the sole source of truth for
  which plugins are registered, their git repository URL, the release/tag
  that ships with the current catalyst release, and their kernel-version
  compatibility. Each catalog entry has a `Compatibility` field: a bare `*`
  means the plugin is compatible with every kernel version — the default
  for a registered plugin, and never grounds for `/sync-framework` to
  deactivate it. A future convention allows specific version constraints in
  that field instead, expressed with the same range syntax used in a
  dependency lock file, to mark a plugin as excluded from named framework
  versions. Supported subcommands:
  - `list` — list all available plugins by type, read from each type's
    `catalog.md`, including each plugin's repository URL, pinned
    release/tag, and compatibility.
  - `activate <name> <version|latest>` — download or update the plugin to the
    specified version (or `latest`) and activate it. This command requires a
    version argument.
  - `download <name> <version|latest>` — download the plugin into the
    framework without activating it. The plugin remains installed and inactive
    until it is explicitly activated.
  - `deactivate <name>` — deactivate a plugin by its registered name, remove
    it from memory, and mark it inactive.
  - `upgrade <name|latest>` — upgrade an already installed plugin to a
    specified version or to the latest available version.
  - `downgrade <name> <version>` — downgrade an already installed plugin to
    the specified version.
  Plugins are not loaded into memory unless they are explicitly activated via
  this command, and on framework startup the framework must scan the installed
  plugin list and activate only those marked active. This is a hard rule.
  The framework defines the interface and lifecycle contract; the plugin itself
  owns its implementation details, operational guidance, and domain-specific
  behavior. Each plugin must live in its own repository, with no exceptions,
  and during framework deployment or synchronization plugins must be pulled
  directly from that plugin repository rather than from this repository.
- `/criterion create <url> | get | push <message> | sync | status` —
  share this deployment's working copy through a criterion repository
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §13, `INVARIANTS.md` INV-18). Each subcommand is
  the matching `catalyst criterion` command (`CLI.md`); the agent adds
  only the judgment around it.
  - `create <url>` — turn a local-only deployment into a shared one: the
    working copy is pushed to `<url>` and `.criterion` becomes a
    submodule of the product repository.
  - `get` — in a fresh clone of the product repository, check out the
    shared working copy (`catalyst criterion join`).
  - `push <message>` — land the working copy's changes as a pull request
    against the shared branch. A conflict stops it with nothing pushed.
  - `sync` — fast-forward to the shared branch; refuses while local work
    is uncommitted or unpushed.
  - `status` — where the working copy stands against the shared branch.
  After a `/dogfood` run that ends clean or ends with fixes applied and
  reverified, offer this command (`create` if not yet shared, `push`
  otherwise) as the natural next step — never run it automatically.
- `/reconcile <RECON-id> accept|accept-with-edits|reject|propose <text>`
  — resolve, or move toward resolving, an open reconciliation case
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §16, `INVARIANTS.md` INV-21): `accept` merges its
  `Proposed` content into the `Entity` it names as-is, `accept-with-edits`
  appends a new `Revisions` row first and merges that instead, `reject`
  leaves the shared branch's version unchanged and the proposer drops or
  reworks their change — each sets `Status` to the matching `Resolved-*` value,
  fills `Resolved`/`Resolver`, and regenerates
  `reconciliations/reconciliations.md` (`catalyst index regen`). `propose <text>` instead appends
  `<text>` as a new `Revisions` row and moves `Status` to `Under Review`
  without resolving anything. **Genuinely role-gated, not advisory**: the
  actor's `reconciliation` field in `IAM/roles/roles.json` must be `full`
  for the three resolving verbs — `propose`-level actors may only use
  `propose`, and `none`-level actors are refused on any verb. If the case
  names a `Workflow` (`WORKFLOW-NNNNNN`, `Rules-of-Rules.md` §19), read
  its `## Steps`/`## Gates / exit criteria` before choosing a verb.
- `/project create <project name>` — install a fresh catalyst deployment
  here, on this explicit request (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §14, INV-2): resolve
  the inputs, run `catalyst init` (working copy in agent-owned space,
  `<app-name>.catalyst` with no path in it, `.criterion` symlink,
  `/.criterion` gitignored). Refuses if a deployment already exists here.
- `/project remove <project name> [force]` — un-link the local
  `<app-name>.catalyst` pointer and `.criterion` symlink; the working
  copy, memory note, and any `criterion` repo are left untouched (retire
  in place). `force` additionally deletes the working copy and this
  agent's memory note for the project — confirm explicitly first; never
  touches a `criterion` repo.
- `/project export <project name> [export filename]` — bundle every file
  under the working copy, plus its pointer fields (never a path), into
  one JSON export. Default filename:
  `<project name>-catalyst-export-<UTC timestamp>.json`.
- `/project import <export filename> [force]` — install a bundle into
  the current project, in this agent's owned location, linked by a
  fresh `.criterion` symlink. Refuses if a deployment already exists here,
  unless `force` is given, in which case it overwrites the existing one
  — confirm explicitly first.
- `/switch-agent [agent-id]` — force the agent-switch procedure (hard
  rule 6, `BOOTSTRAP.md` §1.1, `Rules-of-Rules.md` §14's Agent switching
  procedure) to run now, regardless of whether the running agent's
  identity already appears to match `<app-name>.catalyst`'s `agent`
  field. The manual escape hatch for when the automatic per-session
  check is skipped or only partially completes (e.g. the working copy
  already mirrored but the pointer's `agent` field never updated to
  match). Resolves the owned location of `<agent-id>` (defaulting to the
  running agent's own identifier if omitted) per `BOOTSTRAP.md` §1,
  mirrors `.criterion/` into it if it existed elsewhere (exact copy,
  overwriting the destination — never a partial merge), repoints the
  `.criterion` symlink, updates `<app-name>.catalyst` (`agent`,
  `updated`) unconditionally, and refreshes persistent framework memory.
  No `Taskfile.yml` edit: it reaches the working copy through the
  symlink.
- `/status` — update an artifact or work item's `Status` field, then
  regenerate indexes and journal the change.
- `/audit <file-name>` — analyze the change-impact of the specified file by
  checking the current repository state, the file's role in the framework,
  and the rules or artifacts that depend on it, then return a concise impact
  summary.
- `/run-analysis` — open and execute the analysis playbook from
  `ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md` in the project root, following its steps and
  returning the resulting analysis summary.
- `/sync-framework [latest|<version>]` — synchronize the deployed framework
  with the requested kernel version. If the argument is `latest`, use the
  newest kernel version available from the framework source. If no argument
  is provided, synchronize against the currently installed local version.
- `/check-rules` — verify that rules, domains, and artifact links remain
  consistent and do not conflict: `catalyst check` for the mechanical
  checks, then the judgment ones.
- `/commands list [--filter ...]` — list every slash command available in
  this deployment (name, one-line purpose), sourced from this document's
  §4 — kernel and active-module entries alike. `/help` with no argument delegates here for its command listing
  rather than re-describing it.
- `/journal [--since <date>] [--artifact <id>] [--actor <name>] [--rule
  <id>]` — read-only: filter and report `development/journal.jsonl`
  entries. Never writes to the journal (see §9).
- `/journal-restore <timestamp>` — read-only: reconstruct the tree as it
  stood at `<timestamp>` into a side directory with
  `catalyst journal restore` (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §12). Never overwrites
  the live working tree.
- `/help` — return help documentation for the framework or for a specific
  command when provided.

When the user enters `/user-add <name> <role>: ...`, refuse with a clear
message if `<name>` already has an entry in `IAM/users/users.json`
(point to `/user-modify`/`/user-assign-role`). If `IAM/users/users.json`
or `IAM/roles/roles.json` doesn't exist yet, create them from the
deployment's own current `IAM/users/templates/TEMPLATE-USERS-vN.json`
and `IAM/roles/templates/TEMPLATE-ROLES-vN.json` (the highest `N`
present). If `<role>` isn't one of the roles listed in
`IAM/roles/roles.json`, ask whether to use an existing role or run
`/role-add` for `<role>` first. Otherwise draw the new user's `userid`
with `catalyst userid gen` (never by hand — `Rules-of-Rules.md` §11,
INV-26), append a new entry (`registered`: today, `active: true`,
`roles: [<role>]`, `userid`) and report it. If this is the
project's first registered user, note that the hard "at least one active
user" requirement (§2) is now satisfied.

When the user enters `/user-remove <name>`, refuse with a clear message if
`<name>` has no entry in `IAM/users/users.json`. If `<name>` is the only
`active: true` entry, refuse — this would leave the project with zero
active users (hard rule, §2, INV-25's fundamental-invariant exception to
acting without asking) — and point at `/user-add` for a replacement
first. Otherwise set that entry's `active`
field to `false` — never delete it, since existing `Signed-off-by`
references on already-signed artifacts must stay resolvable. Report the
result.

When the user enters `/user-modify <name> <field> <value>: ...`, refuse
with a clear message if `<name>` has no entry in `IAM/users/users.json`
(point to `/user-add`). Refuse if `<field>` is `roles` (point to
`/user-assign-role`) or `name`/`registered` (identity/audit fields, never
edited in place). Refuse if `<field>` is `active` set to `false` (point to
`/user-remove`, which also checks the "at least one active user" rule).
Otherwise update `<field>` to `<value>` and report the result.

When the user enters `/user-assign-role <name> <role>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `<name>` has no entry in `IAM/users/users.json` (point
to `/user-add`). If `<role>` isn't one of the roles listed in
`IAM/roles/roles.json`, ask whether to use an existing role or run
`/role-add` for `<role>` first. If `<name>`'s `roles` array already
contains `<role>`, say so and make no change. Otherwise append `<role>` to
that array and report the result.

When the user enters `/user-list [--role <role>] [--active-only]`, read
`IAM/users/users.json`. If it doesn't exist, say so rather than
inventing users. Apply `--role`/`--active-only` filters if given, and
report the matching entries. If none match, say so rather than inventing
matches.

When the user enters `/role-add <role> <actions>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `<role>` already has an entry in
`IAM/roles/roles.json` (point to `/role-modify`). If
`IAM/roles/roles.json` doesn't exist yet, create it from the
deployment's own current `IAM/roles/templates/TEMPLATE-ROLES-vN.json`
first. Otherwise append a new entry
(`name: <role>`, `actions: <actions>`) and report it.

When the user enters `/role-modify <role> <actions>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `<role>` has no entry in `IAM/roles/roles.json` (point
to `/role-add`). Otherwise replace that entry's `actions` and report the
result. This never retroactively changes a `Signed-off-by` value already
recorded on an existing artifact.

The seven work-item creation commands (§4) have no procedure here —
they're plugin-contributed, not core; see whichever
project-management-type plugin's own `working-contract.md` is active.

When the user enters `/meta-tag <artefact-id>`, create a new meta-tag artifact
immediately, save it as `tag-<key>-<artefact-id>`, register it in
`meta-tags/meta-tags.md`, and link it to the specified artifact. If the key
is not supplied explicitly, prompt for it. A meta-tag is named by its key
and target, not numbered, so no ID is allocated; `meta-tags/meta-tags.md`
is not an entity index, so its row is added here rather than by
`catalyst index regen`. Then journal the change with
`catalyst journal append --command /meta-tag --action create ...`.

When the user enters `/list <type> [--filter ...]`, inspect the relevant
catalogs and return the matching items. If `type` is `all`, inspect every
supported collection and apply the same filters there. If `type` is
`template`, require `--type <template-type>` and list the matching templates
for that family. If no items match, return an empty result rather than
inventing matches.

When the user enters `/freeze <item-id|item-path|type|template-name>`, resolve
the item to its backing file path, append that path to the root-level
`.frozen` file if it is not already present, and report success. The item is
then protected from automatic framework synchronization until it is
explicitly removed from `.frozen` or re-synchronized with an override.

When the user enters `/migrate-definition <entity-type> <version>`, first
confirm `<entity-type>` names a real entity type (this framework's source
has a `definitions/<entity-type>/` folder for it — see `definitions/
README.md`'s "Entity types covered" list); if not, refuse and name the
valid types. Obtain this framework's current source content the same way
`/sync-framework` does (`SYNCHRONIZE.md`'s "Version rule" — the `release`
branch of the catalyst repository), and check whether `definitions/
<entity-type>/DEFINITION-<ENTITY-TYPE>-v<version>.md` exists there. If it
does not, refuse and report the highest version number that does exist for
that type instead of guessing or rounding to the nearest one. If it does,
overwrite the deployed `.criterion/definitions/<entity-type>.md` with that
exact version's content — this is the one and only way that file ever
changes once deployed, per `SYNCHRONIZE.md`'s definitions carve-out — and
report the old version number moving to the new one.

Every `/catalyzer` subcommand resolves plugin identity, repository URL, and
version information exclusively from the `catalog.md` registry of the
relevant plugin type in catalyst's own repository (e.g.
`framework/kernel/plugins/repository/catalog.md`); a plugin
name with no matching entry in the registry is unregistered, and any
subcommand invoked against it must be refused with a message that the plugin
is not registered. When the user enters `/catalyzer list`, read every plugin
type's `catalog.md` and return the available plugins grouped by type,
each with its registered repository URL, pinned release/tag, and
compatibility. When the user
enters `/catalyzer activate <name> <version|latest>`, look up `<name>` in the
registry to resolve its repository URL, then download or update the plugin
into the framework at `plugins/<type>/` from that repository if it is not
already present, then load it into memory: read that plugin's own
`working-contract.md` and fulfill its Operational-loop section — starting
whatever persistent sub-agent or process it describes — always targeting
the deployed project's own repository root (the project this activation is
happening within), never the catalyst framework's own repository or the
plugin's installation directory. The command requires a version
argument; if the user supplies `latest`, resolve the newest available version
for that plugin from its repository rather than from the pinned tag in the
registry. If a plugin with the same name is already loaded, replace it in
memory with the new instance. When the user enters
`/catalyzer download <name> <version|latest>`, resolve `<name>` against the
registry the same way, then download the plugin into the framework without
activating it; the installed plugin remains inactive until it is explicitly
activated later. A plugin is considered invalid for activation unless its root
directory contains both a `README.md` file and a `working-contract.md` file;
if either file is missing, refuse activation and report the missing
requirement. When the user enters `/catalyzer deactivate <name>`, leave the
plugin installed in the framework but mark it inactive and flush it from
memory. When the user enters `/catalyzer upgrade <name|latest>`, resolve the
plugin's repository URL from the registry, then update the plugin to the
requested version or to the latest available version from that repository.
When the user enters `/catalyzer downgrade <name> <version>`, resolve the
plugin's repository URL from the registry, then downgrade the plugin to the
specified version. Plugins must remain inactive until they are explicitly
activated, and only the repository plugin type exists at this time. On
framework startup, the framework must scan the installed plugins and activate
each one whose `active` metadata flag is true the same way `/catalyzer
activate` loads a plugin into memory (see above). This is a hard rule.

When the user enters `/criterion create <url>`: confirm the user wants
this deployment shared, and that the criterion repository at `<url>`
exists (empty, or holding this working copy's own history) — creating it
on a hosting service is externally visible, so ask before doing it. Run
`catalyst criterion create <url>` (`--branch <name>` only if the user
wants a shared branch other than `criterion`). If it refuses because the
remote branch holds history the working copy lacks, report it: that is
someone else's work or another deployment, never something to overwrite.
Report the steps it printed, then offer to commit the product
repository's staged changes (`.gitmodules`, the `.criterion` gitlink,
the pointer, `.gitignore`) — never commit without assent (INV-4) — and
offer `catalyst criterion protect` (show its output, then `--yes` on
assent).

When the user enters `/criterion get`: in a clone of the product
repository whose `.criterion` is a submodule, run
`catalyst criterion join`. If the joining person is not yet in
`IAM/users/users.json`, they register with `/user-add` (which draws their
`userid`) before signing anything, and land that registration with
`/criterion push` like any other change.

When the user enters `/criterion push <message>`: resolve the signer
(§2) and run `catalyst criterion push -m "<message>" --as <signer>`.
Report the pull request (or the branch to open one from). If the push
stops on a conflict, report the conflicting files and stop: nothing was
pushed. Never resolve the conflict by applying an edit of your own. You
may propose a resolution: open a `RECON-` case (`catalyst id next RECON
--as <signer>`, `Trigger: merge-conflict`, `Baseline` the shared
branch's version, `Proposed` your resolution — `Rules-of-Rules.md` §16),
then `catalyst index regen` and `catalyst journal append`, and leave it
for a human to decide with `/reconcile`. If `catalyst check` or the
integrity check fails, report the errors and fix them as ordinary work
before pushing again.

When the user enters `/criterion sync`: run `catalyst criterion sync`.
If it refuses, report why (uncommitted or unpushed work) and offer
`/criterion push`. Afterwards, offer to commit the moved `.criterion`
gitlink in the product repository, which pins the synced rules.

When the user enters `/criterion status`: run
`catalyst criterion status --fetch` and report it.

When the user enters `/project create <project name>: ...`, refuse if a
`<app-name>.catalyst` pointer or an in-project `.criterion/` already
exists at this project's root — point to `/project import ... force`
instead. Otherwise run the instantiation procedure
(`INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md` §1): resolve the module, rule documents, first
user and agent-owned location (`BOOTSTRAP.md` §1), then run
`catalyst init --name <project name> ...`, which builds the working copy,
writes `<app-name>.catalyst` (no path in it), links `.criterion` (or keeps
the in-project fallback directory) and gitignores `/.criterion`; then the
guide's judgment steps. Report the result; per hard rule 4, nothing is
committed automatically.

When the user enters `/project remove <project name> [force]: ...`,
without `force`: delete this project's `<app-name>.catalyst` and its
`.criterion` symlink (on the in-project fallback, stop treating that
`.criterion/` as active) — nothing else. The working copy, this agent's
memory note, and any `criterion` repo are left exactly as they are (never
delete, retire in place — `Rules-of-Rules.md` §14). With `force`: this is
externally-visible within this agent's own state and hard to reverse, so
confirm explicitly with the user first, distinct from the general assent
already implied by invoking this command; then additionally delete the
working copy (agent-owned, or the in-project fallback) and this agent's
memory note for the project. Never delete a `criterion` repo — that is a separate,
possibly multi-contributor, externally-hosted artifact outside a local
removal's scope, regardless of `force`.

When the user enters `/project export <project name> [export filename]:
...`, resolve the working copy for `<project name>` (`Rules-of-Rules.md`
§14's resolution order) and read every file under it into one JSON
bundle keyed by path relative to `.criterion/`, plus the pointer fields
from `<app-name>.catalyst` (never a path — a legacy `agent-source`,
meaningless outside this machine, is dropped).
Write it to `<export filename>` if given, else
`<project name>-catalyst-export-<UTC timestamp>.json` in the current
directory. Report the result.

When the user enters `/project import <export filename> [force]: ...`,
without `force`: refuse if a `<app-name>.catalyst` pointer or an
in-project `.criterion/` already exists at the current project's
root — point to the `force` form instead. Otherwise (or with `force`,
after confirming explicitly with the user what will be overwritten):
parse the bundle, resolve this agent's own owned location on this
machine (never the exporting machine's), materialize every bundled file
there, create the `.criterion` symlink at the project root pointing at
it and gitignore `/.criterion`, then write `<app-name>.catalyst`
carrying the bundle's pointer fields over as-is (`repoed`,
`catalyst_repo`, `catalyst_repo_url`, `created_by`, `criterion_branch`), with no path. Journal
the import with `catalyst journal append --command /project --action sync`
covering the pointer and `.gitignore`, then report the result.

When the user enters `/status <artefact-id> <status> [force]`, update the
artifact's `Status` field. If the supplied status is one of the valid statuses
for that artifact type, change it normally. If the status is invalid and the
command includes the word `force`, change it to that invalid value anyway. If
the status is invalid and `force` is not supplied, respond that the status
change is impossible and do not modify the artifact. If the artifact ID does
not resolve to an existing artifact, state that the artifact cannot be found.
The valid statuses are the `Status` values the type's entity type
definition allows (a forced value outside them is reported by
`catalyst validate` as an `enum-value` warning). After the edit, run
`catalyst index regen` and
`catalyst journal append --command /status --action status-change ...`
(§4's common ending).

Each plugin must be defined by the following minimum metadata fields: `name`,
`description`, `uuid`, `version`, `active`, and `type`. The plugin definition
template must be updated to include these fields and to record the plugin's
current state in the framework. The framework must read the plugin's
`active` flag at startup and activate only the plugins marked active; this is
mandatory and must not be bypassed. All plugin-specific functionality,
operational guidance, and implementation details must live inside the plugin
package itself; the framework only defines the interface and lifecycle contract.

When the user enters `/audit <file-name>`, inspect the repository and the
current framework state to determine the impact of changes against the named
file. The command must identify whether the file is a rule, template,
artifact, plugin contract, or other framework asset; inspect related indexes,
references, and dependent artifacts (`catalyst validate --json` resolves
every reference mechanically); and return a concise summary of likely
impact, affected areas, and any blocking concerns. If the file cannot be
resolved, report that it was not found and do not invent a result.

When the user enters `/run-analysis`, open and execute the analysis playbook
from `ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md` in the project root, following its steps and
returning the resulting analysis summary. If the playbook is missing, report
that it is unavailable and do not invent missing content.

When the user enters `/sync-framework [latest|<version>] [--force <scope>]`,
inspect the requested kernel version, compare it with the deployed
framework, and synchronize any missing or outdated files and version
information. If the first argument is `latest`, resolve the newest available
kernel version from the framework source. If no version argument is
provided, synchronize against the currently installed local version. Before
synchronizing an item, check the root-level `.frozen` file. If the item's
path is listed there, skip it unless the command includes one of the valid
overrides: `--force <type>`, `--force <item-id>`, or `--force all`. When an
item is refreshed during the synchronization process, it must not remain in
`.frozen`; remove it from the list so the refreshed version no longer carries
the frozen protection. Synchronization must never deactivate an
already-active plugin as a side effect of a kernel version change: a
plugin stays active across the sync unless its entry in the relevant
`plugins/<type>/catalog.md` explicitly excludes the target framework
version via the `Compatibility` field — a bare `*`, or an absent field, is
never grounds for deactivation. Only when that field names a version or
range that excludes the target version may the synchronization process
deactivate the plugin, and it must then report which plugin was deactivated
and why. Synchronization must also never treat a deployed project's
`plugins/<type>/catalog.md` or any installed plugin directory under
`plugins/<type>/<name>/` as framework template content to overwrite
wholesale: once a project has registered or activated any plugin, that
catalog and those directories are project-owned state, so synchronization
may only merge into `catalog.md` — adding rows for newly available plugins
not yet present, and refreshing the pinned `Release`/`Tag`/`Compatibility`
columns of a row that already exists — and must never delete an existing
row, blank the file, or delete or replace an installed plugin's directory
contents. A missing row or directory is something the user resolves
afterward via `/catalyzer activate` or `/catalyzer download`, never
something `/sync-framework` performs or silently corrects on its own. The
refresh always replaces `.criterion/bin/catalyst.pyz` with the release's
`bin/catalyst.pyz`, then journals the sync with
`catalyst journal append --command /sync-framework --action sync` and
runs `catalyst check`. After
the refresh completes, perform a four-eyes
verification pass: one sub-agent verifies the newly deployed framework against
`INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md` and the framework rules, and a second independent
sub-agent repeats the verification from a separate pass. The sync is not
complete until both sub-agents approve the deployment; any disagreement or
failed validation becomes a blocking issue.

When the user enters `/check-rules`, start with `catalyst check`: it
reports the mechanical findings — deployment structure, missing rule
targets and broken links (the chain), journal integrity, and stale or
missing index rows (`CLI.md` lists every code). Then do what only
judgment can: look for rules that conflict with one another
(`Rules-of-Rules.md` §1), domains that overlap or are misassigned, and
artifacts whose content no longer matches the rule they cite. Report
both parts; never hand-edit an index to clear a finding —
`catalyst index regen` does that.

When the user enters `/commands list [--filter ...]`, list every slash
command available in this deployment — name, one-line purpose — sourced
from this document's §4 (the canonical list; never re-enumerate a
subset). Apply `--filter` the same way `/list` does. If this session is
working on catalyst's own repository (`framework/` present
at the root) rather than a deployed project, also list
catalyst-development-only commands that exist there but aren't part of
this deployed set — `/dogfood` (see that repo's own `.claude/commands/`)
is the current example.

When the user enters `/journal [--since <date>] [--artifact <id>]
[--actor <name>] [--rule <id>]`, read `development/journal.jsonl` (one
JSON object per line) and apply whichever filters were given — `--since`
on `timestamp`, `--artifact` on `artifact`, `--actor` on `actor`,
`--rule` on membership in `targets`. Report the matching entries in
timestamp order: what changed, who, which command, which rule(s), and
each entry's `intent`. Paths in older entries may be bare
(working-copy relative), `<repo>:path` or absolute; read them as their
project-root-relative form (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §12). To report the
journal's integrity as well, run `catalyst journal verify`. If the journal
doesn't exist or is empty, say so rather than inventing history. This
command never appends to the journal itself.

When the user enters `/journal-restore <timestamp>`, run
`catalyst journal restore <timestamp> <side-dir>` with a new, empty side
directory (e.g. `.criterion/.journal-restore/<timestamp>/`) — it
materialises every journaled file as of that time and **never writes
into the live working tree**. Report the side directory's path and which
files it contains. Report every path the CLI lists as a missing blob as
unrecoverable rather than silently omitting it.

When the user enters `/help` without any additional entry, run `/commands
list` for the command listing rather than re-describing it, then list
every artifact type and its purpose in a compact reference format. When
the user enters `/help <command>`,
return the detailed help documentation for that command only, including its
syntax, behavior, and prerequisites. If the command is unknown, respond that
it is unsupported and suggest the available commands.

### From module software-engineering

This module contributes the following slash commands. Each one that
creates or changes an artifact allocates IDs with `catalyst id next`, and
ends with `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §4's common steps: `catalyst index regen`,
`catalyst journal append`, and `catalyst check` where no end-of-turn hook
runs it.

- `/create-bug` — create a new bug artifact immediately, register it in
  `development/bugs/bugs.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other bug.
- `/create-req` or `/create-requirement` — create a new requirement artifact
  immediately, register it in `requirements/requirements.md`, and track it in
  the same workflow.
- `/create-test` — create a new test artifact immediately, register it in
  `tests/tests.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other development
  artifact. Prompts for a rule target and domain like
  `/create-bug`/`/create-req` — a test is not exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`
  §1. Optionally accepts `(0,n)` requirements and/or `(0,n)` steps it verifies
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000022-UVqkd7cL`); neither is required. Named
  requirements/steps get the new test's ID appended to their own `Tests` field
  in the same action.
- `/create-feature` — create a new feature entry immediately and register it
  in `features/features.md`. Unlike `/create-bug`/`/create-req`, this never
  prompts for a rule target or domain — features are not rule-linked (see
  `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000009-UVqkd7cL`).
- `/create-step <REQ-id|BUG-id>` — create a new step immediately against
  an existing requirement or bug, register it in `steps/steps.md`, and
  append its ID to that parent's own `Steps` field. Like `/create-feature`,
  never prompts for a rule target or domain — a step inherits its
  parent's (see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000021-UVqkd7cL`). Refuses if `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`
  doesn't resolve to an existing requirement or bug.
- `/roadmap-add <name> <file>` — ingest a new named roadmap from a local
  file, creating `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` from
  `templates/roadmap.template.md` and registering it in
  `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md` (see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000010-UVqkd7cL`).
  Refuses if `<name>` already exists — use `/roadmap-update` or
  `/roadmap-merge` instead.
- `/roadmap-remove <name>` — delete `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` and
  its `roadmaps.md` entry if no row is linked to a `FEAT-`/`REQ-`;
  otherwise retire it in place (never hard-deletes a linked roadmap).
- `/roadmap-update <name> <file>` — re-ingest `<file>` as the new full,
  authoritative version of an existing named roadmap: add new rows,
  update matched rows, flag (never delete) rows missing from the new
  file.
- `/roadmap-merge <name> <update file>` — fold a partial delta file into
  an existing named roadmap: add/update only the rows the delta
  mentions, without flagging anything as missing.

When the user enters `/create-bug: ...`, create a new bug artifact immediately
with the ID from `catalyst id next BUG --as <signer>`, register it in
`development/bugs/bugs.md` (`catalyst index regen`), and track it in the same
workflow as any other bug. It starts `Status: Open` and carries exactly one
`Severity` of `Critical`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low`. If the domain cannot be inferred from context, prompt for the
domain and rule before creating the artifact. Journal it with
`catalyst journal append --command /create-bug --action create --tier fix`,
its `Targets` as `--target`s.

When the user enters `/create-req:` or `/create-requirement: ...`, create a
new requirement artifact immediately with the ID from
`catalyst id next REQ --as <signer>`, register it in
`requirements/requirements.md` (`catalyst index regen`), and track it in the
same workflow. It starts `Status: Draft`. If the domain or target rule
cannot be inferred, prompt for both before creating the artifact. Journal it
with `catalyst journal append --action create --tier feature`, its `Targets`
as `--target`s.

When the user enters `/create-test: ...`, create a new test artifact
immediately using `templates/test.template.md` and the ID from
`catalyst id next TEST --as <signer>`, register it in
`tests/tests.md` (`catalyst index regen`), and track it in the same workflow as any other development
artifact. If the domain or target rule cannot be inferred, prompt for both
before creating the artifact — a test is not exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`
§1 ("no development without a targeted rule"). If the user names one or more
`REQ-NNNNNN`/`STEP-NNNNNN` this test verifies, populate the
`Requirements`/`Steps` fields accordingly, and append the new test's own ID to
each named requirement's/step's own `Tests` field (creating that field if this
is its first test); if `<REQ-id>`/`<STEP-id>` doesn't resolve to an existing
artifact, refuse with a clear message rather than citing a dangling id. Both
fields are optional — a test naming neither is valid as long as
`Targets`/`Domain` are still set. It starts `Status: Draft`. Journal it with
`catalyst journal append --action create --tier feature`, covering the test file, every
requirement/step file whose `Tests` field changed, and the regenerated
indexes.

When the user enters `/create-feature: ...`, create a new feature entry
immediately using `templates/feature.template.md` and the ID from
`catalyst id next FEAT --as <signer>`, register it in
`features/features.md` (`catalyst index regen`), and track it as idea/roadmap content, not
rule-linked development work. Do not prompt for a domain or rule target —
neither field exists on this artifact type. If this feature formalizes an
existing roadmap row (in any `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`), cite that
row's `RM-NNNNNN` ID in the new feature's `Roadmap` field and set the row's
`Status` to `Triaged` and `Linked` to the new `FEAT-NNNNNN` (the row's first
linked entry). If the user later asks to start building a registered
feature, create a `REQ-NNNNNN` requirement instead (prompting for
domain/target rule as usual), link it back to the `FEAT-NNNNNN` entry's
`Requirement(s)` field, and **append** (never replace) that `REQ-NNNNNN` to
the roadmap row's `Linked` list — a feature may reasonably decompose into
more than one requirement, each added to `Linked` as it's opened, per
`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-000021-UVqkd7cL`. Roadmap rows are edited in place by
hand. Journal the change with `catalyst journal append --action create`
(no `--target`: features are not rule-linked), covering the feature file,
the index and any roadmap file touched.

When the user enters `/create-step <REQ-id|BUG-id>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `<REQ-id|BUG-id>` doesn't resolve to an existing file
under `requirements/` or `development/bugs/`. Otherwise create a new
step immediately using `templates/step.template.md` and the ID from
`catalyst id next STEP --as <signer>`, register it in
`steps/steps.md` (`catalyst index regen`), set its `Parent` field to `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`, and
append its own `STEP-NNNNNN` ID to that parent's `Steps` field (creating
the field if this is its first step). Do not prompt for a domain or rule
target — neither field exists on this artifact type; it inherits
`<REQ-id|BUG-id>`'s own `Targets`/`Domain`. New steps start `Status:
planned` unless the user says
work is already underway, in which case `in-progress`. Journal it with
`catalyst journal append --action create --tier feature` (`--tier fix` when
the parent is a `BUG-`), covering the step file, the
parent file and the regenerated index.

When the user enters `/roadmap-add <name> <file>: ...`, refuse with a clear
message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` already exists (point to
`/roadmap-update`/`/roadmap-merge`). Otherwise read `<file>` from the
local filesystem, identify its distinct items, and create
`development/roadmaps/<name>.md` from `templates/roadmap.template.md` with
one `RM-NNNNNN` row per item (`Description`: a sentence or two summarizing
the item, drawn from `<file>` — not a restatement of `Title`; `Status: Not
triaged`, `Linked: *(none)*`), IDs continuing the global sequence across
every existing named roadmap — never reused, never guessed: the first
from `catalyst id next RM --as <signer>`, the rest consecutive from it in
the same write. Register the new roadmap in
`development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md` (a hand-edited row — roadmaps have no
generated index), journal it with
`catalyst journal append --action create`, then report the roadmap name
and the IDs assigned.

When the user enters `/roadmap-remove <name>`, refuse with a clear message
if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist. If every row's `Linked`
field is empty, delete the file and its `roadmaps.md` entry outright and
report that. If any row has a non-empty `Linked` field, do **not** delete
anything — instead add a `Retired` field (today's date) to the file, mark
its `roadmaps.md` entry `retired`, leave every row and `RM-NNNNNN` ID exactly
as they are, and tell the user it was retired rather than removed because
removing it would break a live `FEAT-`/`REQ-` cross-reference. Either way,
journal it with `catalyst journal append --action retire` covering the
roadmap file and `roadmaps.md`.

When the user enters `/roadmap-update <name> <file>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist (point to
`/roadmap-add`). Otherwise treat `<file>` as the new full, authoritative
version of this roadmap: add a new `RM-NNNNNN` row for each item not already
present (with its own `Description`, same rule as `/roadmap-add`, numbered
from `catalyst id next RM`), update
the `Title`/`Description`/`Notes` of any row that matches an item in
`<file>` by title/description similarity (ask the user rather than
guessing when a match is ambiguous), and flag — in `Notes`, never by
deleting — any existing row whose item no longer appears in `<file>`.
Update the file's `Source` and `Last updated` fields, journal it with
`catalyst journal append --action update`, then report a short summary of
what was added/updated/flagged.

When the user enters `/roadmap-merge <name> <update file>: ...`, refuse
with a clear message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist
(point to `/roadmap-add`). Otherwise treat `<update file>` as a partial
delta, not the full roadmap: apply the same add/update matching rule as
`/roadmap-update` for only the items `<update file>` actually contains,
but do not compare against or flag any row it doesn't mention, and do not
change the `Source` field — only `Last updated`. Journal it with
`catalyst journal append --action update`, then report a short summary of
what was added/updated.

When the user enters `/show-backlog`, run `catalyst index regen`, then
inspect the current artifact indexes (open bugs — Status `Open`/`Under Review`/`Fixed` — by severity, open
requirements — Status `Draft`/`Proposed`/`Vetted`/`Active` —, work items with no
linked `REQ-`/`BUG-` doc, rules with no open work targeting them, feature
ideas with no requirement yet, and every `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`
not marked `Retired`, rows grouped by roadmap name then Status),
**overwrite `development/BACKLOG.md` in full** with the result (from
`templates/backlog.template.md`'s structure, with a refreshed timestamp),
**also refresh every active `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`** in place —
for each `RM-NNNNNN` row, resolve every `FEAT-`/`REQ-` its `Linked` field
names (if any — it's a list, not a single id) and set `Status` to
`Not triaged` (nothing linked) / `Triaged` (only a `FEAT-` linked) /
`In progress` (at least one linked `REQ-` isn't yet `Completed` or
`Abandoned`) / `Done` (every linked `REQ-` is `Completed` or `Abandoned`)
accordingly, leaving `Title`/`Notes`/`Source`
untouched; journal any roadmap row whose `Status` changed with
`catalyst journal append --action status-change` — and also report the
same summary to the user in this turn. No
file write is optional — a stale `BACKLOG.md`, or any roadmap file that
doesn't match the last `/show-backlog` run, is itself a bug in the
deployment.

## 5. Domain field

Every item's `Domain` field is the `DOMAIN` code of the rule(s) it targets,
from `rules/domains/` — not free text. (An entity type the active
module declares exempt from this document's rules is not a development
artifact under this document and carries no `Domain` field.)

## 6. Development-artifact IDs

Per `Rules-of-Rules.md` §5: `<PREFIX>-(NNNNNN)-(userid)`, where `<PREFIX>`
is one of the active module's rule-linked entity-type ID prefixes —
sequential per type, zero-padded 6 digits, never reused, never renumbered,
plus the signer's `userid` as a trailing suffix from the moment they're
signed (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §20, INV-26). The number is unique per type and
signer: in a shared deployment two contributors may hold the same number
under different userids (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §6, §13). The next ID comes from
`catalyst id next <PREFIX> --as <signer>`, never from reading the index by
hand. Meta-tags use a file-name pattern of
`tag-<key>-<artefact-id>` rather than a sequential numeric ID. This is a
hard requirement for all new artifacts and work items: every item name
must be more than the bare ID and must follow the format
**`<artifact-id>-<short-summary>`**. The corresponding markdown filename must
also follow the same descriptive pattern as
**`<artifact-id>-<short-summary>.md`**, not simply `<artifact-id>.md`.
Example, for the `example-process` module's `ITEM` entity type
(`MODULE-SPECIFICATION.md`): `ITEM-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation`
or `ITEM-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation.md`. The same rule must be
applied retroactively during framework deployment or synchronization to existing
deployed items whose names or filenames are still only the bare ID.

## 7. Closing an item

Before closing a development artifact, ensure the corresponding entry
exists in its individual file and is reflected in the relevant index file
(`catalyst index regen`).
What each of the active module's entity types requires before it may be
closed — and with which terminal `Status` values — is defined by the
module, in its own §3 entries and entity definitions.

## 8. Retired rules and development work

Retiring a *rule* is `Rules-of-Rules.md` §4's process — status marker to
🗑, reason plus date appended, ID never reused. Closing a *dev-artifact*
(any rule-linked development artifact of the active module) as a terminal
negative status such as `wontfix`/`rejected`/`abandoned` is independent
of that: closing an artifact never retires the rule(s) it targeted, and
retiring a rule never auto-closes the artifacts that cite it. Each is
closed on its own, citing the other's ID and the reason, so the history
stays traceable in both directions rather than one silently orphaning the
other.

## 9. Journaling

`development/journal.jsonl` is an append-only, transaction-log-grade
record — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` §12 for the full entry schema (exact
before/after git blob pointers per file, project-root-relative paths, one
or more `intent` statements, the `targets` rule IDs, the `writer`) and the
point-in-time restore mechanism (`/journal-restore`, materializes a
reconstructed tree into a side directory — never overwrites the live
tree).

**Every command in §4 that creates, modifies, closes, or retires a
rule-linked artifact, rule, domain, or work item, or changes a `Status`
field, appends exactly one journal entry as its last step** — after
everything that command's own section above already specifies, not
instead of any of it. Concretely: make the edit(s), then run
`catalyst journal append` once, with a `--file` for every file the
command touched; it records each file's real `before`/`after` hashes and
pins the blobs. Entries are written only this way, never by hand, and the
agent's judgment goes into `--intent`, `--target` and `--tier`.

**Ceremony tiers.** `--tier chore|fix|feature` records how much ceremony a
change carries: a **chore** changes no rule's behaviour, a **fix** restores
a documented rule's behaviour, a **feature** adds or changes behaviour. The
agent picks the tier, states it to the user before starting, and escalates
(chore → fix → feature) if the change turns out bigger; when unsure, the
higher tier. A chore needs no artifact: its one entry has no `--target`
(`targets: []`), which says explicitly that it serves no rule. What a fix
and a feature require — which artifacts, which steps, which tests — is the
active module's, in its §3 contribution. A tiered change is journaled even
when no §4 command is involved: `--command` is then the tier itself
(e.g. `--command chore --action update --tier chore`). Entries are immutable — never edited, deleted, or reordered
afterward, the same "never delete, retire in place" principle as a
retired rule (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §4) applies here in its strictest
form: nothing about a written entry ever changes, period.

**Traced commits.** The chain reaches the product repository's history
too (INV-5): every product commit's message cites an artifact or rule ID
that resolves in this deployment — full (`<PREFIX>-NNNNNN-<userid>`,
`<doc-prefix>-<DOMAIN>-NNNNNN-<userid>`) or short (the same without the
userid) — or its subject starts `chore:` or `chore(<scope>):` when the
change is a chore. A fix or a feature cites its artifact; a commit that
only edits a rule cites the rule. Merge commits are not checked.
`catalyst hook commit-msg`, installed with `catalyst hook install` (with
the user's assent — it writes into `.git/hooks`), refuses an untraced
commit; `catalyst trace <range>` re-checks new commits in CI
(`--pattern-only` where CI has no working copy). The agent writes traced
messages itself and never bypasses the hook (`--no-verify`) without the
user's say-so. History from before the check was introduced is not
checked.

Two read-only commands operate on the journal without writing to it
themselves: `/journal [--since <date>] [--artifact <id>] [--actor <name>]
[--rule <id>]` reconstructs/filters the history for review, and
`/journal-restore <timestamp>` materializes the tree as it stood at that
point into a side directory for inspection (`catalyst journal restore`).
`catalyst journal verify` checks the hash chains, blobs and pins, and
flags any journaled file edited without an entry.

This is kernel infrastructure, distinct from the `catalyst-git`
plugin's continuous rule-compliance auditing of a *deployed* project
(`INVARIANTS.md` INV-13) — the journal applies to catalyst's own
self-deployment too, and answers "what changed, why, and can I get back
to how it was," not "did anything just break a rule."
