## 3. Standard document types

This module contributes seven entity types. Four of them — bugs,
requirements, house-keeping items, and tests — are **development
artifacts**, fully bound by `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §1 (`Targets`, `Domain`,
closed against a rule). Feature entries, roadmap items, and steps are
related but exempt schemes, described after the table.

| Type | Folder | Template | ID prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bug | `bugs/` | `templates/bug.template.md` | `BUG-NNNNNN` |
| Requirement | `requirements/` | `templates/requirements.template.md` | `REQ-NNNNNN` |
| House-keeping | `house-keeping/` | `templates/house-keeping.template.md` | `HK-NNNNNN` |
| Test | `tests/` | `templates/test.template.md` | `TEST-NNNNNN` |

House-keeping is this module's one category where "no rule applies" is a
legitimate answer to `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §1 (pure repo hygiene with no
bearing on any documented behavior or process) — but it must be stated
explicitly, not left blank.

Feature entries (`FEAT-NNNNNN`, folder `features/`, template
`templates/features.template.md` → `TEMPLATE-FEATURE.md`) are a related but
**separate, non-rule-linked** scheme — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-009`.
They document possible future work, are not one of the four
development-artifact types above, and are exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s
rules (no `Targets`, no `Domain`, never "done" against a rule). When a new
feature actually needs to be developed, open a `REQ-NNNNNN` requirement —
never a `BUG-NNNNNN` — to track it.

Roadmap items (`RM-NNNNNN`, table rows inside `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`
files — one file per named roadmap, template `templates/roadmap.template.md`,
index `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md`) sit one level above feature entries
— see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-010`. They are populated by
`/roadmap-add`/`/roadmap-update`/`/roadmap-merge` from an external source file
rather than created one at a time, and are exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s
rules the same way feature entries are (no `Targets`, no `Domain`, never
"done" against a rule). Formalizing a roadmap item means opening a
`FEAT-NNNNNN` for it via `/create-feature`, citing the `RM-NNNNNN` ID in the
feature's `Roadmap` field. A roadmap item of real size is expected to
decompose into **more than one** requirement rather than one oversized
`REQ-NNNNNN` standing in for the whole item — its row's `Linked` field names
every `FEAT-`/`REQ-NNNNNN` currently associated with it, not just one.

Steps (`STEP-NNNNNN`, folder `steps/`, template `templates/step.template.md`)
sit one level *below* a requirement or a bug — see `Rules-of-Rules.md`
`rr-META-021`. Each names exactly one parent — a `REQ-NNNNNN` or a `BUG-NNNNNN`
(the `Parent` field) — and records one concrete unit of implementation
work performed toward it (files touched, commands run, how it was
verified). Like feature entries and roadmap items, a step is exempt from
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s rules (no `Targets`, no `Domain` of its own — it
inherits its parent's), but unlike them it's created *during* active
implementation, not before it: a requirement or bug worth calling
`in-progress` is expected to have at least one step opened against it,
and isn't closeable as `done`/`fixed` until every one of its steps is
`done` or `abandoned`. Opened and closed as the work itself happens, not
batched afterward, per `INVARIANTS.md` INV-29.

Tests (`TEST-NNNNNN`, folder `tests/`, template `templates/test.template.md`)
join this module's development-artifact types as of framework `0.30.0` — see
`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-022`. Unlike features, roadmap items, and steps,
a test is **not** exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`'s rules: it always carries
its own `Targets`/`Domain`, vetted the same way a bug or requirement is. On
top of that, a test may independently name `(0,n)` `REQ-NNNNNN` and `(0,n)`
`STEP-NNNNNN` it verifies — both optional, and neither implies the other.
Named requirements/steps get the new test's ID appended to their own `Tests`
field in the same action — the mirror image of a requirement's `Steps` field.

#### Hard rule: individual files and indexes

- Bugs, requirements, house-keeping items, and tests each follow
  `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §3's individual-file and index hard rules. Their
  index files are:
  - `bugs/bugs.md` for the bug index.
  - `requirements/requirements.md` for the requirements index.
  - `house-keeping/house-keeping.md` for the house-keeping index.
  - `tests/tests.md` for the test index.
  - Feature entries and steps are indexed the same way, in
    `features/features.md` and `steps/steps.md`.
- **This is a hard requirement.** `development/BACKLOG.md` always
  exists — seeded from `templates/backlog.template.md` on first deploy —
  as the go-to document for developers to review work to be done and
  current status. It is not hand-maintained: `/show-backlog` regenerates
  it in full every time it runs, so it never drifts from the real
  indexes — including every `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`. See
  `INVARIANTS.module.md` INV-14.
- **This is also a hard requirement.** `development/roadmaps/` and its
  `roadmaps.md` index always exist (empty is fine — individual named
  roadmaps are created only via `/roadmap-add`). Within any
  `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` that does exist, only the
  `/roadmap-add`/`-update`/`-merge`/`-remove` commands and `/show-backlog`
  (Status/Linked refresh) ever change it; hand-editing anything but a
  row's Notes column is pointless, the same way hand-editing `BACKLOG.md`
  is. See `INVARIANTS.module.md` INV-15.

- **Bug**: an existing ✅ rule doesn't actually hold in the running system,
  or formalizes an already-known ⚠️/❌ rule into trackable, closeable work.
  Never introduces a new rule by itself.
- **Requirement**: an explicit, tracked requirement that captures
  user/business behavior that must be implemented and tested — this is the
  artifact to open when a new feature needs to be developed, never a bug. It
  must be vetted against every existing rule document (`Rules-of-Rules.md`
  `rr-META-001` conflict check) before it's opened, it always carries a
  `Domain`, and it always answers — targets and/or proposes — one or more
  rules (and, if needed, a new domain — see `Rules-of-Rules.md`
  `rr-META-006`/`rr-META-007`) inline in the requirement doc so rule and
  requirement are reviewed together. None of those three are optional.
- **House-keeping**: dev-support tooling/process, not product behavior.
  Still targets a rule where one exists — most commonly a `rr-META-*`
  process rule.
- **Test**: verifies that a targeted rule actually holds, the same
  `Targets`/`Domain` requirement as a bug or requirement. Optionally
  names `(0,n)` requirements and/or `(0,n)` steps it verifies, on top of
  its own rule target — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-022`.

#### Rule documents' Linked Artifacts quick index

Every rule document carries a `## Linked Artifacts — Quick Index` heading
(kernel `INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md` §1). This module lists there each open
`BUG-NNNNNN` whose `Targets` include one of the document's rules, as
`BUG-NNNNNN — <Name> (<Status>)`, and removes the line once the bug is
closed. Other artifact types are not listed.

#### Domain field

Feature entries under `features/` (and roadmap items and steps) are not
development artifacts under `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` and carry no `Domain`
field of their own — see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-009`.

#### Development-artifact IDs

Per `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-006`: `(BUG|REQ|HK|TEST)-(NNNNNN)-(userid)`,
global per type, sequential, zero-padded 6 digits, never reused, plus the
signer's `userid` suffix (`rr-META-020`, INV-26), under
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §6's naming rule. Example:
`BUG-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation` or
`BUG-000001-Ab3xR9pQ-login-form-validation.md`, and
`REQ-000002-Ab3xR9pQ-password-reset-flow` or
`REQ-000002-Ab3xR9pQ-password-reset-flow.md`.

#### Closing an item

Before closing a bug or requirement, ensure the corresponding entry exists in
its individual file and is reflected in the relevant index file
(`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §7).

- **Bug**: not closeable as "fixed" without its test-plan item landing,
  **and** every `STEP-NNNNNN` in its `Steps` field is `done` or
  `abandoned` (`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-021`).
- **Requirement**: not closeable as "done" until the acceptance criteria and
  rule targets are reflected in the implementation and tests, **and** every
  `STEP-NNNNNN` in its `Steps` field is `done` or `abandoned`
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-021`).
- **Step**: not closeable as "done" without its own Verification section
  filled in; `abandoned` requires a reason there instead.
- **House-keeping**: closeable once its stated verification passes.
- **Test**: not closeable as "passing" without its own Actual outcome
  section reflecting a real run; `failing`/`blocked` require the same
  section explaining why.

Closing a bug, requirement, or house-keeping item as
`wontfix`/`rejected`/`abandoned` never retires the rule(s) it targeted, and
vice versa (`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §8).

## 4. Slash-command entry points

This module contributes the following slash commands:

- `/create-bug` — create a new bug artifact immediately, register it in
  `bugs/bugs.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other bug.
- `/create-req` or `/create-requirement` — create a new requirement artifact
  immediately, register it in `requirements/requirements.md`, and track it in
  the same workflow.
- `/create-test` — create a new test artifact immediately, register it in
  `tests/tests.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other development
  artifact. Prompts for a rule target and domain like
  `/create-bug`/`/create-req` — a test is not exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`
  §1. Optionally accepts `(0,n)` requirements and/or `(0,n)` steps it verifies
  (`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-022`); neither is required. Named
  requirements/steps get the new test's ID appended to their own `Tests` field
  in the same action.
- `/create-feature` — create a new feature entry immediately and register it
  in `features/features.md`. Unlike `/create-bug`/`/create-req`, this never
  prompts for a rule target or domain — features are not rule-linked (see
  `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-009`).
- `/create-step <REQ-id|BUG-id>` — create a new step immediately against
  an existing requirement or bug, register it in `steps/steps.md`, and
  append its ID to that parent's own `Steps` field. Like `/create-feature`,
  never prompts for a rule target or domain — a step inherits its
  parent's (see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-021`). Refuses if `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`
  doesn't resolve to an existing requirement or bug.
- `/roadmap-add <name> <file>` — ingest a new named roadmap from a local
  file, creating `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` from
  `templates/roadmap.template.md` and registering it in
  `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md` (see `Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-010`).
  Refuses if `<name>` already exists — use `/roadmap-update` or
  `/roadmap-merge` instead.
- `/roadmap-remove <name>` — delete `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` and
  its `roadmaps.md` entry if no row is linked to a `FEAT-`/`REQ-`;
  otherwise retire it in place (never hard-deletes a linked roadmap).
- `/roadmap-update <name> <file>` — re-ingest `<file>` as the new full,
  authoritative version of an existing named roadmap: add new rows,
  update matched rows, flag (never delete) rows missing from the new
  file.
- `/roadmap-merge <name> <update file>` — fold a partial delta file into
  an existing named roadmap: add/update only the rows the delta
  mentions, without flagging anything as missing.
- `/show-backlog` — summarize open work, blockers, and missing links,
  refresh `development/BACKLOG.md` with the result, and refresh every
  active `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`'s Status/Linked columns from
  the `FEAT-`/`REQ-` each row is linked to.

When the user enters `/create-bug: ...`, create a new bug artifact immediately,
register it in `bugs/bugs.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other
bug. If the domain cannot be inferred from context, prompt for the domain and
rule before creating the artifact.

When the user enters `/create-req:` or `/create-requirement: ...`, create a
new requirement artifact immediately, register it in
`requirements/requirements.md`, and track it in the same workflow. If the
domain or target rule cannot be inferred, prompt for both before creating the
artifact.

When the user enters `/create-test: ...`, create a new test artifact
immediately using `templates/test.template.md`, register it in
`tests/tests.md`, and track it in the same workflow as any other development
artifact. If the domain or target rule cannot be inferred, prompt for both
before creating the artifact — a test is not exempt from `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`
§1 ("no development without a targeted rule"). If the user names one or more
`REQ-NNNNNN`/`STEP-NNNNNN` this test verifies, populate the
`Requirements`/`Steps` fields accordingly, and append the new test's own ID to
each named requirement's/step's own `Tests` field (creating that field if this
is its first test); if `<REQ-id>`/`<STEP-id>` doesn't resolve to an existing
artifact, refuse with a clear message rather than citing a dangling id. Both
fields are optional — a test naming neither is valid as long as
`Targets`/`Domain` are still set.

When the user enters `/create-feature: ...`, create a new feature entry
immediately using `templates/features.template.md`, register it in
`features/features.md`, and track it as idea/roadmap content, not
rule-linked development work. Do not prompt for a domain or rule target —
neither field exists on this artifact type. If this feature formalizes an
existing roadmap row (in any `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`), cite that
row's `RM-NNNNNN` ID in the new feature's `Roadmap` field and set the row's
`Status` to `Triaged` and `Linked` to the new `FEAT-NNNNNN` (the row's first
linked entry). If the user later asks to start building a registered
feature, create a `REQ-NNNNNN` requirement instead (prompting for
domain/target rule as usual), link it back to the `FEAT-NNNNNN` entry's
`Requirement(s)` field, and **append** (never replace) that `REQ-NNNNNN` to
the roadmap row's `Linked` list — a feature may reasonably decompose into
more than one requirement, each added to `Linked` as it's opened, per
`Rules-of-Rules.md` `rr-META-021`.

When the user enters `/create-step <REQ-id|BUG-id>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `<REQ-id|BUG-id>` doesn't resolve to an existing file
under `requirements/` or `development/bugs/`. Otherwise create a new
step immediately using `templates/step.template.md`, register it in
`steps/steps.md`, set its `Parent` field to `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`, and
append its own `STEP-NNNNNN` ID to that parent's `Steps` field (creating
the field if this is its first step). Do not prompt for a domain or rule
target — neither field exists on this artifact type; it inherits
`<REQ-id|BUG-id>`'s own `Targets`/`Domain`. New steps start `Status:
planned` unless the user says
work is already underway, in which case `in-progress`.

When the user enters `/roadmap-add <name> <file>: ...`, refuse with a clear
message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` already exists (point to
`/roadmap-update`/`/roadmap-merge`). Otherwise read `<file>` from the
local filesystem, identify its distinct items, and create
`development/roadmaps/<name>.md` from `templates/roadmap.template.md` with
one `RM-NNNNNN` row per item (`Description`: a sentence or two summarizing
the item, drawn from `<file>` — not a restatement of `Title`; `Status: Not
triaged`, `Linked: *(none)*`), IDs continuing the global sequence across
every existing named roadmap — never reused, never guessed. Register the
new roadmap in `development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md`, then report the
roadmap name and the IDs assigned.

When the user enters `/roadmap-remove <name>`, refuse with a clear message
if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist. If every row's `Linked`
field is empty, delete the file and its `roadmaps.md` entry outright and
report that. If any row has a non-empty `Linked` field, do **not** delete
anything — instead add a `Retired` field (today's date) to the file, mark
its `roadmaps.md` entry `retired`, leave every row and `RM-NNNNNN` ID exactly
as they are, and tell the user it was retired rather than removed because
removing it would break a live `FEAT-`/`REQ-` cross-reference.

When the user enters `/roadmap-update <name> <file>: ...`, refuse with a
clear message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist (point to
`/roadmap-add`). Otherwise treat `<file>` as the new full, authoritative
version of this roadmap: add a new `RM-NNNNNN` row for each item not already
present (with its own `Description`, same rule as `/roadmap-add`), update
the `Title`/`Description`/`Notes` of any row that matches an item in
`<file>` by title/description similarity (ask the user rather than
guessing when a match is ambiguous), and flag — in `Notes`, never by
deleting — any existing row whose item no longer appears in `<file>`.
Update the file's `Source` and `Last updated` fields, then report a short
summary of what was added/updated/flagged.

When the user enters `/roadmap-merge <name> <update file>: ...`, refuse
with a clear message if `development/roadmaps/<name>.md` does not exist
(point to `/roadmap-add`). Otherwise treat `<update file>` as a partial
delta, not the full roadmap: apply the same add/update matching rule as
`/roadmap-update` for only the items `<update file>` actually contains,
but do not compare against or flag any row it doesn't mention, and do not
change the `Source` field — only `Last updated`. Report a short summary of
what was added/updated.

When the user enters `/show-backlog`, inspect the current artifact indexes
(open bugs by severity, in-progress/proposed requirements, work items with no
linked `REQ-`/`BUG-` doc, rules with no open work targeting them, feature
ideas with no requirement yet, and every `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`
not marked `Retired`, rows grouped by roadmap name then Status),
**overwrite `development/BACKLOG.md` in full** with the result (from
`templates/backlog.template.md`'s structure, with a refreshed timestamp),
**also refresh every active `development/roadmaps/<name>.md`** in place —
for each `RM-NNNNNN` row, resolve every `FEAT-`/`REQ-` its `Linked` field
names (if any — it's a list, not a single id) and set `Status` to
`Not triaged` (nothing linked) / `Triaged` (only a `FEAT-` linked) /
`In progress` (at least one linked `REQ-` isn't yet `done`) / `Done`
(every linked `REQ-` is `done`) accordingly, leaving `Title`/`Notes`/`Source`
untouched — and also report the same summary to the user in this turn. No
file write is optional — a stale `BACKLOG.md`, or any roadmap file that
doesn't match the last `/show-backlog` run, is itself a bug in the
deployment.
