argument-hint: <name> <file>

Ingest a new named roadmap from a local file. Full spec:
`.criterion/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §4, template:
`.criterion/development/roadmaps/templates/TEMPLATE-ROADMAP-v1.md`.
Input: $ARGUMENTS

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as `<name> <file>`. If either is missing, ask for it.
2. If `.criterion/development/roadmaps/<name>.md` already exists, refuse and point to
   `/roadmap-update` or `/roadmap-merge` instead.
3. If `.criterion/development/roadmaps/` doesn't exist yet, create it, seed
   `.criterion/development/roadmaps/templates/TEMPLATE-ROADMAP-v1.md` from
   the software-engineering module's `templates/roadmap.template.md`, and
   create an empty `.criterion/development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md` index.
4. Read `<file>` from the local filesystem and identify its distinct
   roadmap items (headings, bullets, table rows — whatever structure the
   source uses).
5. Determine the next `RM-NNNNNN` ID by scanning every existing
   `.criterion/development/roadmaps/*.md` file for the highest current number —
   never guess or reuse.
6. Resolve who is signing this ingest (`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §2), and
   confirm they have a `userid` (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §11/INV-26) —
   register one first if not. Every item's `ID` gets that signer's
   `userid` appended as its suffix (`Rules-of-Rules.md` §20); every item
   ingested in the same run shares the same signer and suffix.
7. Create `.criterion/development/roadmaps/<name>.md` from
   `.criterion/development/roadmaps/templates/TEMPLATE-ROADMAP-v1.md`, with `Name: <name>`,
   `Source: <file>`, `Added`/`Last updated` set to today, and one row per
   identified item (`ID`: `RM-NNNNNN-<userid>`; `Description`: a sentence
   or two summarizing the item, drawn from `<file>` — not a restatement
   of `Title`; `Status: Not triaged`, `Linked: *(none)*`,
   `Signed-off-by`: the resolved signer).
8. Register `<name>` in `.criterion/development/roadmaps/roadmaps.md`.
9. Report the roadmap name and the IDs assigned. Do not commit or push —
   leave changes unstaged unless the user asks otherwise.
