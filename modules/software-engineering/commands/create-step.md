description: Create a new step against an existing requirement or bug, recording one concrete unit of implementation work
argument-hint: <REQ-id|BUG-id> <short description>
---

Create a new step. Full spec:
`.criterion/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §4, template: `.criterion/steps/templates/TEMPLATE-STEP-v1.md`.
Input: $ARGUMENTS

1. Refuse with a clear message if `<REQ-id|BUG-id>` doesn't resolve to an
   existing file under `requirements/` or `development/bugs/`.
2. Resolve the next sequential `STEP-NNNNNN` ID from `steps/steps.md` plus
   a directory listing of `steps/` — never guess or reuse a number.
3. Create the step file from the template, `Parent` set to
   `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`, `Status: planned` (or `in-progress` if the user
   says work is already underway). Do not prompt for a domain or rule
   target — neither field exists on this artifact type; it inherits
   `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`'s.
4. Register it in `steps/steps.md`, and append its ID to
   `<REQ-id|BUG-id>`'s own `Steps` field (creating the field if this is
   its first step).
5. Report the new step's ID and filename.
