# Backlog — template

> Copy this file to `development/BACKLOG.md` on first deploy. Unlike every
> other template here, this is not a fill-in-once document: `/show-backlog`
> **overwrites it in full** every time it runs, regenerating each section
> from the real indexes. Hand-editing it is pointless — the next
> `/show-backlog` run replaces whatever you wrote. See
> catalyst's `framework/kernel/rules-of-development.template.md` (composed with this module's `code-of-conduct.module.md`)
> §2 and `INVARIANTS.md` INV-14.
